Introduction To NumPy
=======================

Installing NumPy and other packages using conda
----------------------------------------------------

In addition to numpy some of the examples use
matplotlib and scipy for plotting and fitting. 

To install numpy and other python related packages 
I recommend the conda package manager which will
install python too.  This does not interfere with 
any preexisting python on your system.

* https://conda.io/docs/
* https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html

After installing miniconda3, you can::

    conda install numpy ipython matplotlib     ## bare minimum 
    conda install scipy                        ## fitting + much more  
    conda install sympy                        ## symbolic maths  

All the most popular machine learning packages are also available
via conda.

  Presention slides in html, with many NumPy examples.
  Once the images load  (it takes a while sometimes) the html provides a javascript 
  interface to navigate the slide pages, with menu at bottom right.

  Learning NumPy is ideal preparation for Learning CUDA...


Hello World Examples
----------------------

This repository contains a few very simple examples
of using NumPy.

* https://bitbucket.org/simoncblyth/intro_to_numpy/src/

Start by cloning the repository to a machine with NumPy installed::

    which hg    # Mercurial is required
    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/simoncblyth/intro_to_numpy



load/save NumPy arrays from C++
-----------------------------------

Highlighted Examples
-----------------------

recon.py

    * generate arrival times at coordinates on a sphere of a "disturbance" starting 
      within the sphere, assuming a normal distribution around geometric time

    * perform NLL minimization to find "disturbance" origin position parameters 
      from the arrival times at positions on the sphere 

    * positions, times and params are saved as npy files, for use by 
      https://bitbucket.org/simoncblyth/intro_to_cuda/src/default/RecTest.cu
